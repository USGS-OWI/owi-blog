## Introduction

There are many different R packages for dealing with spatial data. The main distinctions between them involve the types of data they work with --- raster or polygonal --- and the sophistication of the analyses they can do.  Raster data can be thought of as pixels, similar to an image, while polygonal data consists of lines or polygons.  Spatial data manipulation can be quite complex, but creating some basic plots can be done with just a few commands. In this post, we will show simple examples of each for plotting gage locations, and link to some other more complex examples.

#Setting up
We'll start with a polygon example.  First, let's download an example shapefile (a polygon) of a HUC8 from western Pennsylania, using the `sbtools` package to access Sciencebase. Then we'll retrieve gages with discharge from this watershed using the `dataRetrieval` package.  The `readOGR` function from `rgdal` reads shapefiles into R.  `rgdal` accesses the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library](http://www.gdal.org/) (GDAL) system library.

```{r get_data}
library(sbtools)
library(dataRetrieval)
library(rgdal)

item_file_download(sb_id = "5a83025ce4b00f54eb32956b", 
                   names = "huc8_05010007_example.zip", 
                   destinations = "huc8_05010007_example.zip", 
                   overwrite_file = TRUE)
unzip('huc8_05010007_example.zip', overwrite = TRUE)
huc_poly <- readOGR('huc8_05010007_example')
class(huc_poly)

huc_gages <- whatNWISdata(huc = "05010007", parameterCd = "00060", service="uv")
print(huc_gages)

```

The `huc_poly` object is a new type of object that we haven't seen --- a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`.  It has several different parts, or "slots".  You can click on the object in your Rstudio environment window to see what is inside, or run `slotNames(t)`.  Slots can be referenced directly using `@`, e.g. `huc_poly@data`.  The `data` slot is like a regular R data frame, and contains information about the polygon.  You can look at its contents in the nice Rstudio data frame format using `View(huc_poly@data)`.  Since this shapefile only contains a single polygon, it only has one row .  The `polygons` slot contains the actual vertices of the polygon.  If there were multiple polygons in this object, the `plotOrder` field would determine the order in which they are drawn.  The `bbox` field gives the bounding box of all polygons in the object, and `proj4.string` gives the projection.  These fields can be used and modified to change or reference specific things about the object.  In this examples, we will use the `bbox` slot in order to request a map zoomed to this HUC.

Now that we understand this new object, let's make some maps.

## Raster map example
For the raster map, we will use the `ggmap` package to create a political map and a satellite basemap for the HUC.  Since the basemaps that `ggmap` uses are quite detailed, they are too large to include with the package and must be retrieved from the web with the `get_map` function.  For the `location` argument, we are taking the bounding box slot from the `huc_poly` object (originally a 2D vector) and converting it to a vector with `c()`.   The `ggmap` function is analogous to the `ggplot` function in the `ggplot2` that you have likely already used.  It creates the base map, which we can then add things to.  Many of the commands used here are the same as in the `ggplot2` package.

```{r, raster_map_base, alt.text = "plain base maps", fig.cap = c("street base map","satellite base map")}
library(ggmap)

#setting zoom to 9 gives us a bit of padding around the bounding box
basemap_streets <- get_map(maptype = "roadmap", location = c(huc_poly@bbox), zoom = 9)
basemap_satellite <- get_map(maptype = "satellite", location = c(huc_poly@bbox), zoom = 9)
street_map <- ggmap(basemap_streets) 
satellite_map <- ggmap(basemap_satellite)
print(street_map)
print(satellite_map)
```

Now we can start adding to our maps.  To use a spatial polygon with `ggmap`, we first need to convert it to a standard data frame.  Fortunately, the `tidy` function in the `broom` package does this for us.  Also similar to `ggplot`, functions like `geom_polygon` and `geom_point` add to your base map.

```{r raster_map_add, alt.text = "base maps with HUC and gages", fig.cap = c("satellite map with HUC and gages","street map with HUC and gages")} 
tidy_huc_poly <- broom::tidy(huc_poly)
satellite_map + geom_polygon(data = tidy_huc_poly, aes(long, lat, group = group),
                             color = "white", fill = NA) + 
  geom_point(data = huc_gages, aes(x = dec_long_va, y = dec_lat_va, color = "Gage")) + 
  labs(color = NULL, x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude") + 
  geom_text(data = huc_gages, aes(label=site_no, x = dec_long_va, y = dec_lat_va), 
                                 hjust = 0, size=2.5, nudge_x = 0.02, col = "yellow")

street_map + geom_polygon(data = tidy_huc_poly, aes(long, lat, group = group),
                             color = "black", fill = NA) + 
  geom_point(data = huc_gages, aes(x = dec_long_va, y = dec_lat_va, color = "Gage")) + 
  labs(color = NULL, x = "Longitude", y ="Latitude") + 
  geom_text(data = huc_gages, aes(label=site_no, x = dec_long_va, y = dec_lat_va), 
                                 hjust = 0, size=2.5, nudge_x = 0.02)
```

## Polygon map example
If we don't want any raster background to our maps, we can use base plotting and the `maps` package.  This style of map can be nicer for insets or large scale maps that would be cluttered with a raster background.  The `maps` package provides easily accessible political boundary maps, that can be overlaid with other shapefiles.  As with regular base plotting, you can think of creating maps like painting --- every layer has to go on in the right order.  You can't remove things without starting over.  Fortunately, you can start over with just a few keystrokes since you are scripting your plot!  Run these commands one by one to see the map take shape --- first we create a blank state map, then add county lines in white, then the HUC boundary, then the gage points, and then the legend.

```{r poly-map-state, fig.cap="Polygon map of Pennsylvania", alt.text = "Polygon map of Pennsylvania"}
library(maps)
map(database = 'state', regions = 'Pennsylvania', col = "tan", fill = TRUE, border = NA)
#this draws all PA counties since the regions argument uses partial matching
map(database = 'county', regions = 'Pennsylvania', col = "white", fill = FALSE, add = TRUE)
plot(huc_poly, col = NA, add = TRUE)
points(x = huc_gages$dec_long_va, y = huc_gages$dec_lat_va, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 0.7)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("Gage", "Subbasin boundary"), pch = c(19,NA), lty = c(NA, 1),
       col = c("red", "black"), title = "Legend")
title("Conemaugh Subbasin")


```

Similarly, we could create a map zoomed in to the HUC polygon.  We will start by plotting the HUC first, so that it sets the plot's boundaries, although if we wanted something else "on the bottom" we could specify a bounding box to the `map` function (you could access the coordinates from the shapefile with `huc_poly@bbox`.  

```{r poly_map_zoomed_in, fig.cap = "Polygon map zoomed to HUC", alt.text = "Polygon map zoomed to HUC"}
  plot(huc_poly, col = "dodgerblue", border = NA)
  map(database = 'county', regions = 'Pennsylvania', add = TRUE, col = "lightgray")
  box()
  points(x = huc_gages$dec_long_va, y = huc_gages$dec_lat_va, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 0.7)
  legend("bottomleft", legend = c("Gage", "Conemaugh subbasin"), pch = c(19,NA), lty = c(NA, 1),
       col = c("red", "dodgerblue"), title = "Legend", lwd = c(1,15), bg = "wheat")
  text(x = huc_gages$dec_long_va, y = huc_gages$dec_lat_va, labels = huc_gages$site_no,
       pos = 4, cex = 0.7)
```

## Other packages and examples
Like plotting in R, there are endless intricacies to making maps, and we are only really scratching the surface here.  Some other packages that you may find useful for certain applications include:

- [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html): The workhorse package for handling spatial data 
- [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html): A newer package by many of the same authors as `sp` that simplifies spatial data manipulation
- [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html): For working with your own raster data
