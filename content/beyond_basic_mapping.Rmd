## Introduction

There are many different R packages for dealing with spatial data. The main distinctions between them involve the types of data they work with --- raster or vector --- and the sophistication of the analyses they can do.  Raster data can be thought of as pixels, similar to an image, while vector data consists of points, lines, or polygons.  Spatial data manipulation can be quite complex, but creating some basic plots can be done with just a few commands. In this post, we will show simple examples of raster and vector spatial data for plotting a watershed and gage locations, and link to some other more complex examples.

#Setting up
First, let's download an example shapefile (a polygon) of a HUC8 from western Pennsylania, using the `sbtools` package to access [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/). The `st_read` function from the `sf` (for "simple features") package reads in the shapefile.  We will be using `sf` throughout these examples to manipulate the points and polygon for the gages and HUC.  Then we'll retrieve gages with discharge from this watershed using the `dataRetrieval` package.  Both `dataRetrieval` and `sbtools` are covered in our [USGS Packages curriculum](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/usgs-packages/).

```{r get_data}
library(sbtools)
library(dataRetrieval)
library(sf)

item_file_download(sb_id = "5a83025ce4b00f54eb32956b", 
                   names = "huc8_05010007_example.zip", 
                   destinations = "huc8_05010007_example.zip", 
                   overwrite_file = TRUE)
unzip('huc8_05010007_example.zip', overwrite = TRUE)
#note st_read takes the folder, not a particular file
huc_poly <- st_read('huc8_05010007_example')
class(huc_poly)
str(huc_poly)
st_geometry(huc_poly)
st_bbox(huc_poly)
st_crs(huc_poly)

huc_gages <- whatNWISdata(huc = "05010007", parameterCd = "00060", service="uv")
head(huc_gages)
```

The `huc_poly` object is a new type of object that we haven't seen --- it has classes `sf` as well as `data.frame`.  Looking inside the object with the `str` command, we can see it is structured very much like a `data.frame` with several factor columns, except for the `geometry` column, which is of type `sfc_POLYGON`.  `sf` provides various functions to extract useful information from this kind object, generally prefixed with `st_`.  `st_geometry` extracts the entire geometry part of the object; `st_bbox` extracts the bounding box from the geometry; and `st_crs` extracts the coordinate reference system.  There are others, but we will use these three to get the parts of the `sf` object we need for plotting.    

Now that we understand this new object, let's make some maps.

## Raster map example
For the raster map, we will use the `ggmap` package to create a road and satellite basemaps for the HUC.  Since the basemaps that `ggmap` uses are quite detailed, they are too large to include with the package and must be retrieved from the web with the `get_map` function.  For the `location` argument, we are getting the bbox from the `huc_poly` object.  `st_bbox` returns the bbox in the format we need, except for the names, which we add   with `setNames`.  The `ggmap` function is analogous to the `ggplot` function in the `ggplot2` package that you have likely already used.  It creates the base map, which we can then add things to.  Many of the commands used here are from the `ggplot2` package (`ggmap` imports them), and others could be used to further customize this map.  

Note that `ggmap` is probably not a good choice if you need your data to be in a particular projection.  Compared to base plotting, it provides simplicity at the cost of control.  

```{r, raster_map_base, alt.text = "plain base maps", fig.cap = c("street base map","satellite base map")}
library(ggmap)

#setting zoom to 9 gives us a bit of padding around the bounding box
bbox <- setNames(st_bbox(huc_poly), c("left", "bottom", "right", "top"))
basemap_streets <- get_map(maptype = "roadmap", location = bbox, zoom = 9)
basemap_satellite <- get_map(maptype = "satellite", location = bbox, zoom = 9)
street_map <- ggmap(basemap_streets) 
satellite_map <- ggmap(basemap_satellite)
print(street_map)
print(satellite_map)
```

Now we can start adding to our maps. First, we convert the `huc_gages` data.frame to an `sf` object using `st_as_sf`, assigning it the same coordinate reference system as `huc_poly` using `st_crs`.  `ggplot` functions like `geom_sf` and `geom_text` add to your base map.

```{r raster_map_add, alt.text = "base maps with HUC and gages", fig.cap = c("satellite map with HUC and gages","street map with HUC and gages")} 
huc_gages_sf <- st_as_sf(huc_gages, coords = c("dec_long_va", "dec_lat_va"), 
                         crs = st_crs(huc_poly), remove = FALSE)
satellite_map + geom_sf(data = huc_poly,
                        inherit.aes = FALSE,
                        color = "white", fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = huc_gages_sf, inherit.aes = FALSE, color = "red") +
  geom_text(data = huc_gages_sf, 
            aes(label = site_no, x = dec_long_va, y = dec_lat_va),
            hjust = 0, size=2.5, nudge_x = 0.02, col = "yellow")

street_map + geom_sf(data = huc_poly,
                        inherit.aes = FALSE,
                        color = "black", fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = huc_gages_sf, inherit.aes = FALSE, color = "red") +
  geom_text(data = huc_gages_sf, aes(label = site_no, x = dec_long_va, y = dec_lat_va),
             hjust = 0, size=2.5, nudge_x = 0.02, col = "black")
```

## Vector map example
If we don't want any raster background to our maps, we can use base plotting and the `maps` package.  This style of map can be nicer for insets or large scale maps that would be cluttered with a raster background.  The `maps` package provides easily accessible political boundary maps, that can be overlaid with other shapefiles.  As with regular base plotting, you can think of creating maps like painting --- every layer has to go on in the right order.  You can't remove things without starting over.  Fortunately, you can start over with just a few keystrokes since you are scripting your plot!  Run these commands one by one to see the map take shape --- first we create a blank state map, then add county lines in white, then the HUC boundary, then the gage points, and then the legend.  Note that we use the `st_geometry` function inside of the plot command so that we only plot the `huc_poly` and `huc_gages_sf` geometry, and not the other information in their data frames.

```{r poly-map-state, fig.cap="Polygon map of Pennsylvania", alt.text = "Polygon map of Pennsylvania"}
library(maps)
map(database = 'state', regions = 'Pennsylvania', col = "tan", fill = TRUE, border = NA)
#this draws all PA counties since the regions argument uses partial matching
map(database = 'county', regions = 'Pennsylvania', col = "white", fill = FALSE, add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(huc_poly), col = NA, add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(huc_gages_sf), add = TRUE, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 0.7)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("Gage", "Subbasin boundary"), pch = c(19,NA), lty = c(NA, 1),
       col = c("red", "black"), title = "Legend")
title("Conemaugh Subbasin")


```

Similarly, we can create a map zoomed in to the HUC polygon.  Note that we set the x and y limits of the map by extracting the limits of the `bbox` object we created earlier.  We can use the names `left`, `right`, etc. because `bbox` is a named vector.  

```{r poly_map_zoomed_in, fig.cap = "Polygon map zoomed to HUC", alt.text = "Polygon map zoomed to HUC"}
  map(database = 'county', regions = 'Pennsylvania', col = "lightgray", 
      xlim = bbox[c('left', 'right')], ylim = bbox[c('bottom', 'top')])
 plot(st_geometry(huc_poly), col = "dodgerblue", border = NA, add = TRUE)
  box()
 plot(st_geometry(huc_gages_sf), add = TRUE, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 0.7)
  legend("bottomleft", legend = c("Gage", "Conemaugh subbasin"), pch = c(19,NA), lty = c(NA, 1),
       col = c("red", "dodgerblue"), title = "Legend", lwd = c(1,15), bg = "wheat")
  text(x = huc_gages$dec_long_va, y = huc_gages$dec_lat_va, labels = huc_gages$site_no,
       pos = 4, cex = 0.7)
```

## Other packages and examples
Like plotting in R, there are endless intricacies to making maps, and we are only really scratching the surface here.  Some other packages that you may find useful for certain applications include:

- [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html): For working with your own raster data
- [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html): The original workhorse package for handling spatial data.  `sf` is largely replacing it, but you will see it a lot when Googling things.
- [geoknife](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geoknife/index.html): A USGS package that utilizes the [Geo Data Portal](https://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/how-to-gdp/) for processing gridded data.  Covered in the [packages curriculum](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/usgs-packages/).
 - [inlmisc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/inlmisc/index.html): Another USGS package for creating high-level graphics, [demonstrated in this blog post by Jason Fisher](https://owi.usgs.gov/blog/inlmiscmaps/).
