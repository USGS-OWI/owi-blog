We are excited to use many of the JavaScript data visualizations in R using the [`htmlwidgets`](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) package in future blog posts. Having decided on using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), one of our first tasks was to figure out a fairly straightforward way to incorporate these widgets. This post describes the basic process to get a basic [`leaflet`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet)  map in our Hugo-generated blog post.

In this example, we are looking for phosphorus measured throughout Wisconsin with the [`dataRetrieval`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dataRetrieval) package. Using [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr), we filter the data to sites that have records longer than 15 years, and more than 50 measurements.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dataRetrieval)
pCode <- c("00665")
phos.wi <- readNWISdata(stateCd="WI", parameterCd=pCode,
                     service="site", seriesCatalogOutput=TRUE)

library(dplyr)
phos.wi <- filter(phos.wi, parm_cd %in% pCode) %>%
            filter(count_nu > 50) %>%
            mutate(period = as.Date(end_date) - as.Date(begin_date)) %>%
            filter(period > 15*365)
```


Plot the sites on a map:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
leafMap <- leaflet(data=phos.wi) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(~dec_long_va,~dec_lat_va,
                   color = "red", radius=3, stroke=FALSE,
                   fillOpacity = 0.8, opacity = 0.8,
                   popup=~station_nm)

```

Next, we use the `htmlwidgets` package to save a self-contained html file. The following code could be generally hid from the reader using `echo=FALSE`. 


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(htmlwidgets)
library(htmltools)

currentWD <- getwd()
dir.create("static/leaflet", showWarnings = FALSE)
setwd("static/leaflet")
saveWidget(leafMap, "leafMap.html")
setwd(currentWD)

```


The html that was saved with the `saveWidget` function can be called with the `iframe` html tag. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
<iframe seamless src="/static/leaflet/leafMap/index.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
```

<iframe seamless src="/static/leaflet/leafMap/index.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

When building the site, Hugo converts the "leafMap.html" to "leafMap/index.html". 

One issue for our Hugo theme was that the created widget page is included in the overall blog index. The was fixed by adding a line to the overall index.html layout page to only lists pages with dates above Jan. 1, 1970 (so really, any legitimate date):

```{r eval=FALSE}
{{ if ge $value.Date.Unix 0 }}
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    {{ .Render "grid" }}
  </div>
{{ end }}

```

A screenshot of the map was taken to use for the thumbnail in the blog index.
